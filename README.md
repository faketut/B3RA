# Basel III Risk Analyzer (B3RA)

## Description

The Basel III Risk Analyzer (B3RA) is a Python-based tool for simulating and analyzing Basel III capital adequacy ratios and risk-weighted assets. It allows users to generate synthetic portfolio data, calculate key Basel III ratios, and run stress tests to assess the impact of different economic scenarios on a financial institution's capital adequacy.

## Features

*   **Synthetic Portfolio Generation:** Generates synthetic portfolio data with various asset classes, internal ratings, and risk factors.
*   **RWA Calculation:** Calculates Risk Weighted Assets (RWA) based on asset class and internal ratings.
*   **Basel III Ratio Calculation:** Calculates key Basel III ratios, including Tier 1 ratio, Total Capital ratio, Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), and Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR).
*   **Stress Testing:** Simulates the impact of different stress scenarios (e.g., Mild Recession, Severe Recession, Financial Crisis) on capital adequacy.
